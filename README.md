# Scheduler-Notifier
### Scheduler Notifier

The purpose behind a notification is to inform about an event and encourage him to take action.
Notifications help people to remember things. It is a small piece of text which appears on the desktop or mobile screen to inform the user about the updates or any other important pieces of information.

### Other areas where you can use this approach:

- Set daily tracker for COVID stats.

- Daily notification to take medicine.

- Hourly notification to drink water.
